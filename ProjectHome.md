# Description #
This extension provides the functionality to create and manage advertising campaigns where their sponsors give a donation to the promoter based on the number of visits into those campaigns.

The content manager can configure options like the campaign start and end dates, the time between user visits, maximum number of visits, etc. The system will automagically change the state of a campaign when those conditions are met (hidding the access links from the content).
